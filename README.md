# FattyLiverModeling
A computational system biology approach for identifying and optimizing in-vitro models that better recapitulate human patients in fatty liver diseases.

## Run example analysis.
main_example_run.R: An R script to run a line-by-line analysis of the whole approach, beginning by using a clinical dataset and an in-vitro dataset, and identifying and interpreting in the end an extra basis for better spaning the human phenotypes.
## Folders
1. data : Folder where you should put your raw data. (Be careful larger files cannot be pushed into GitHub and can potentially crash it)
2. preprocessing : Pre-processed data along with algorithms for the pre-processing of the raw data. (Be careful larger files cannot be pushed into GitHub and can potentially crash it)
3. modeling : Machine learning and statistical analysis algorithms of the project.
4. optimization : Scripts for performing in-silico maximization of the human variance captured by the MPS datase and analyzing the results.
5. results : Storage of the results and figures of the studies.
6. utils: Auxilary functions used by other scripts in this study.
