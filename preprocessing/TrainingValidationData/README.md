### Subfolders containing 10-fold validation split for training models
1. 10fold_PCA_lasso : Contains the split human data used to train TransCompR-based models, using LASSO to predict phenotypes from the PC-space of the MPS data.
2. 10fold_sparsePCA_lasso: Contains the split human data used to train TransCompR-based models, by using sparase PCA to make the projection and LASSO to predict phenotypes from the sPC-space of the MPS data.
