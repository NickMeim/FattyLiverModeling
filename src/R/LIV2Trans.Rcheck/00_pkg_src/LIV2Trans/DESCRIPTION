Title: Identifies an extra basis to better predict in vivo phenotypes
        from in vitro models

Description: This package train a PLSR or PLS-DA model to predict in vivo phenotype from molecular features.    Then it has the ability to identify an extra basis vector for the molecular space of an in vitro model so that the loss of performance when passing in vivo data through the in vitro pricipal component space is minimized.
