## Scripts for performing in-silico maximization of the human variance captured by the MPS datase and analyzing the results.
1. maximizeExplainedVariance.ipynb : Jupyter notebook to perform the maximization of the variance, perturb in-silico the gene expression and save the results.
2. translate_perturbed.R : Train TransCompR-based translation model by using the computationally perturbed data.
